This blog post represents a fresh start. A new hosting provider, a new way of presenting the content, a new everything. The only thing that remains and stays constant is me &mdash; and being human, even I am changing constantly.

After the preceding paragraph, it feels a little redundant to say this, but I will anyway: the design and layout of this new site are still very much in flux. Hold on to your hard hats, y'all.
